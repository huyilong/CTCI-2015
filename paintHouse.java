/*
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: 
red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. 
For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; 
costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so onâ€¦ 

Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note: All costs are positive integers.

relation: to paint house[i]
use different color from house[i-1]
use valid with minimum cost

dp[i][color] = cost[i][color] + min(dp[i-1][color1], dp[i-1][color2])
